# Study-Room-Three.js
Study on my own study room.
Also study on diamond double refraction invented by me [(fanfares!)](https://freesound.org/embed/sound/iframe/350428/simple/large/), values can be set via scrollbars and numeric entries.

Code:
The modified fresnel shader fresnelshader.js (original in the Three.js master's codebase), and the scene logic in scene_logic.js.

The chrome ball is here to show the reflected image as well. Why worn? Simply to fit the style.
